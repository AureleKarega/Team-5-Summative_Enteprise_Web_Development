# NYC Taxi Trip Analytics Dashboard 

## Overview
This fullstack application analyzes the **New York City Taxi Trip dataset**, enabling users to explore urban mobility patterns interactively.  
The system performs data **extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL)**, stores it in a **relational database**, and exposes APIs to visualize patterns like fare, trip distance, and tip trends.

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/nyc-taxi-dashboard.git
cd nyc-taxi-dashboard
```

### 2. Backend Setup
Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed.

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python etl_pipeline.py   # Cleans and loads data into database
python app.py            # Starts Flask API server
```

The backend will run at:  
‚û°Ô∏è `http://localhost:7070

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser or use Live Server in VS Code.  
It will automatically connect to the backend API to fetch trip insights.
